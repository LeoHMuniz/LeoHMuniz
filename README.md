 ### Hello there!
I'm Leonardo Henrique and i'm an aspiring developer!
Currently studying and chasing the opportunities before they can even come to me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my career transition/introduction.
As an Outsourced resource on the public sector, I'm going for the development career.

Familiar with SCSS, Bootstrap, Python and SQL.
  
- ðŸ¤” I always accept help if it's for my self improvement and to make me a better professional or even a better person.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm eclectic when It comes to music, but I do prefer Heavy Metal, like avenged sevenfold or disturbed and Brazilian RAP, like Sabotage, Racionais mc's. I love reading light novels, mainly chinese, mangas (any type, manhwa, manhua or manga), and watching anime.
